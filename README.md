# Neutron Reaction

This repository aims to build an interactive nuclear data evaluation platform.

## Features
- Interactive web application built with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
- Multi-step workflow for nuclear data evaluation
- A home page describing the platform's goals and main features
- Navigation to nuclide selection, help, documentation, and additional pages
- Basic test structure using `pytest`

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies (if any).
2. Run the Dash application:

   nuclide selection, help, documentation, and other sections of the site.
