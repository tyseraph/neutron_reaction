This repository contains simple web pages for selecting isotopes.

- `web/index.html` links to the [NUBASE](https://www-nds.iaea.org/nubase/nubase2020.htm) dataset used to obtain isotope properties.
- `web/isotopes.html` loads a list of isotopes from `web/isotopes.json` so that the number of selectable isotopes can be changed externally.
