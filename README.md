# Neutron Reaction

This repository aims to build an interactive nuclear data evaluation platform.

## Features
- Interactive web application built with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
- Multi-step workflow for nuclear data evaluation
- A welcoming home page linking to platform introduction, workflow diagram,
  and a quick-start video
- Basic test structure using `pytest`

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies (if any).
2. Run the Dash application:
   ```bash
   python -m neutron_reaction.app
   ```

   The application opens with a page titled `欢迎使用核数据智能评价平台` where
   you can access the platform introduction, workflow diagram, and a quick-start
   video, or immediately begin a new task.

## Directory Structure

- `src/`: source code of the platform
- `tests/`: unit tests
