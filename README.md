This repository contains a basic HTML page for selecting isotopes. The isotopes are loaded from a JSON file. 

Currently the isotopes list is a small sample. To use a full dataset, replace `isotopes.json` with a comprehensive list of known isotopes.

To view the page locally, open `index.html` in a browser.
